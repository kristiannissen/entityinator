*EntityInator provides a simple way to build entities*

This project is a sandbox made to understand Lavarels Eloquent relationship features. Using this makes it possible to build different types of entities such as String, Integer or Float, basically any Entity you can imagine.

If you are looking for a way to learn Laravels Eloquent Many To Many relationship model, check out the test case I used to build this project.

Enjoy!
